1. Palindrome
    * A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same either forwards or backwards. 
  For instance "noon", "did", "live on time emit no evil" are all palindromes. 
  Write a Java program that determines if a given String is a palindrome. 
  Your program should be able to use different Strings by easily modifying your code.
