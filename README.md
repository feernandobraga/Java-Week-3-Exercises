# Week3-Exercises
Some more simple exercises coded on week 3

- Palindrome
    * A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same either forwards or backwards. 
  For instance "noon", "did", "live on time emit no evil" are all palindromes. 
  Write a Java program that determines if a given String is a palindrome. 
  Your program should be able to use different Strings by easily modifying your code.
 
- Exercise 1
   * Write a program to take an input number from user between 1 and 24. Use if statement and case statement to display the output. 
   If the input is less than 18, print a "Good day" greeting, otherwise print "Good evening".
   Write a while loop that prints out multiples of 5 between 10 and 95
   Write a while loop to add up the values 1 to 10 and print the sum once the loop has finished
   
   
- Exercises 2: 
    * Write a program that prompts the user to input three numbers. 
    The program should then output the numbers in non-descending order. 
    
- Exercise 3:
    * Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer between 0 and 35. 
    If the number is less than or equal to 9, the program should output the number; 
    otherwise, it should output A for 10, B for 11, C for 12, ... and Z for 35.
